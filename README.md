### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aishwarya, a Computer Science graduate student at Purdue University. I worked as a Full-stack developer at BETSOL Software for 2 years on their Backup and Recovery product, Zmanda. I'm passionate about Machine Learning and Web development. The following is a brief summary of the projects I've worked on.
